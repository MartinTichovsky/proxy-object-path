## About

This micro project was inspired by [`ts-object-path`](https://github.com/Taras-Tymchiy/ts-object-path) and its solution. My solution is simpler and a major idea was to make the code safer. Instead of using strings in inputs, i18next, etc. we would like to connect them with names generated from a Type (because of typescript checking = less mistakes).

Let's say we have an object which is declared as type ExampleType and then a function, component, etc. This function accepts a parameter 'key' and will pass a value into the object with this expression `object[key] = value`. Providing string as a name is not good practice in TypeScript, because programmers can easily make a typo. See a [React example](https://github.com/MartinTichovsky/proxy-object-path/tree/master/example).

![Example of using](https://github.com/MartinTichovsky/__sources__/raw/master/ezgif-7-5e8c2990f28b.gif)

## Example

```ts
type ExampleType = {
  username: string;
  password: string;
}

const example: ExampleType = {} as ExampleType;

function passValue(key: string, value: string) {
  example[key] = value;
}

passValue("username", "martin");
```

This example is not very safe, safer will be this:

```ts
type ExampleType = {
  username: string;
  password: string;
}

const exampleProxy = createProxy<ExampleType>();
const example: ExampleType = {} as ExampleType;

function passValue(key: string, value: string) {
  example[key] = value;
}

passValue(fullObjectPath(exampleProxy.username), "martin");
```

Because `fullObjectPath(exampleProxy.username)` will be checked by typescript and you can't make a mistake in the name "username".

**Note:** This is a very dumb example. Of course, nobody is going to approach this problem like above, the major thing is the idea, that when some components, functions or whatever receive a name and by this name pass a value to your existing object, it gives you full control, which is better.

## Usage

```ts
type ExampleType = {
  property: string;
  secret: {
    password: string;
  }
}

const exampleProxy = createProxy<ExampleType>();

const last = lastObjectProperty(exampleProxy.secret.password)
// last = "password" 

const full = fullObjectPath(exampleProxy.secret.password)
// full = "secret.password"

const i18 = i18ObjectPath(exampleProxy.secret.password)
// i18 = "secret:password"
```

If you want to use the full potential of object path, you can use functions `set` and `get` from [`lodash`](https://github.com/lodash/lodash).
